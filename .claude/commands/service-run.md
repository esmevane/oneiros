description: Start the oneiros service in the foreground
---

Run `oneiros service run` to start the oneiros service in the foreground. The service listens on a Unix domain socket and handles all brain operations.

Use `oneiros service run &` to run in the background, or prefer `oneiros service start` for managed service operation.
