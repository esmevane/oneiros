Run `oneiros guidebook $ARGUMENTS` to produce a cognitive guidebook for the named agent. The guidebook explains how to use the oneiros cognitive system: recording cognitions, storing memories, the agent lifecycle, and how to extend the system by creating new textures, levels, and agents.

Use after dreaming, or whenever you need a reference for how the cognitive tools work.
