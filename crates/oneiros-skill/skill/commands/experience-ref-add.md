Run `oneiros experience ref add $ARGUMENTS` to link an additional cognitive record to an experience. Requires the experience ID, the record ID, and the record kind (cognition, memory, experience, or storage).

Use `--role` to label the reference's role in the experience (e.g., "origin", "result", "foundation").
