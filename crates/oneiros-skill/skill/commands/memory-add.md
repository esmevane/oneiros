Run `oneiros memory add $ARGUMENTS` to store a consolidated knowledge record. Requires the agent name, retention level, and the memory content.

Memories are distilled knowledge at a specific retention tier. Use working level for ephemeral notes, session for session-scoped context, project for long-lived knowledge, and archival for permanent records.
