description: Retire an agent from active service
argument-hint: <agent-name>

Run `oneiros recede $ARGUMENTS` to retire the named agent. This records a recede lifecycle event and removes the agent from the brain.

Recede is permanent — the agent's cognitive records remain but the agent itself is removed.
