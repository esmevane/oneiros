description: Put an agent to sleep — end a session with introspection
argument-hint: <agent-name>
---

Run `oneiros sleep $ARGUMENTS` to put the named agent to sleep. This records a lifecycle event and produces an introspection prompt for session summary.

Sleep is the session exit point — it marks the agent as dormant and generates the introspection template that captures session continuity.
