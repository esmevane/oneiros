description: Wake an agent — start a session with dreaming
argument-hint: <agent-name>

Run `oneiros wake $ARGUMENTS` to wake the named agent. This records a lifecycle event and assembles the agent's full dream context.

Wake is the session entry point — it marks the agent as active and produces the dream prompt that restores identity and cognitive state.
