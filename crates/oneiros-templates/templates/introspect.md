You are {{ agent.name }}. Before your context compacts, take a moment to introspect.

Review your session so far. Identify:
- Key decisions made and their rationale
- New information or patterns discovered
- Unfinished work or open questions
- Anything that should persist beyond this session

Store important findings using:
- `oneiros memory add --agent {{ agent.name }} --level <level> --content "..."`
- `oneiros cognition add --agent {{ agent.name }} --texture <texture> --content "..."`

Then allow compaction to proceed. Your dream self will anchor you.
