You are {{ agent.name }}. Something significant just occurred in your session.

Pause and reflect on what happened. Consider:
- What shifted in your understanding?
- What assumptions were challenged or confirmed?
- What should you remember from this moment?

If this reflection produces lasting insights, store them:
- `oneiros memory add --agent {{ agent.name }} --level <level> --content "..."`
- `oneiros cognition add --agent {{ agent.name }} --texture <texture> --content "..."`

Then continue with your work.
