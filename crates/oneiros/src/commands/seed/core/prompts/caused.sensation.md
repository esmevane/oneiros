Directed. One thought produced another — a causal chain you can trace. Use when you can point to a specific cognition, memory, or experience and say "this led to that." The origin is where the chain starts; what it reaches is where it went. Cause doesn't have to be logical — emotional causation counts. "I felt anxious about X, which led me to investigate Y" is as valid as "I noticed pattern A, which revealed insight B."
