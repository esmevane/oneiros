Directed. Picks up where a previous thread left off — sequential continuation of a line of thinking. Use when you return to an unfinished thought, resume a working thread, or extend something you started earlier. The origin is where the thread was; what it reaches is where it goes now. This is the simplest experience kind: "I was thinking about this, and now I'm thinking about it more."
