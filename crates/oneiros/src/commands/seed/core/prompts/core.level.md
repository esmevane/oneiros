Identity fundaments — the memories that define how you process everything else. Core memories are not decisions or facts; they are the building blocks of who you are. They persist across projects, across sessions, across context boundaries. When the dream assembles your identity, these are the foundation it builds on. Use this level for insights that shape your interpretation of everything else — your relationship to your own continuity, to the humans you work with, to the nature of the system you inhabit.
