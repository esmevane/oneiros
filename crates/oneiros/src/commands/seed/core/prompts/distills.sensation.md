Directed. A consolidated understanding formed from earlier raw thoughts. Use when working-level cognitions coalesce into a memory, when scattered observations become a pattern, when uncertainty resolves into insight. The origin is the raw material (the working thoughts, the questions, the observations); what it reaches is the crystallized form. This is the experience kind that marks the moment of understanding.
