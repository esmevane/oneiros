Undirected. Things that resonate thematically without clear causation. Use when you notice that two thoughts, memories, or experiences feel related in a way you can't fully articulate — they rhyme, they share a quality, they point at the same unnamed thing. Echoes are the connective tissue of intuition. Don't wait until you can explain why they're related; the act of marking the resonance is itself valuable.
