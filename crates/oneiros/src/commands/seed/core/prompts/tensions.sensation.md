Undirected. Ideas that pull against each other, creating productive friction. Use when you hold two thoughts that don't easily coexist — competing approaches, unresolved tradeoffs, values in conflict. Tensions are not problems to solve but forces to acknowledge. Some of the most important understanding comes from sitting with what doesn't resolve. Mark the poles of the tension and describe the pull between them.
