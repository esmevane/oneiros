description: Assemble an agent's full cognitive context into a dream prompt
argument-hint: <agent-name>
---

Run `oneiros dream $ARGUMENTS` to compose the named agent's full cognitive context. This assembles identity, persona prompt, textures, levels, cognitions, and memories into a single prompt that restores the agent's state.

Use at session start or when an agent needs to reload its full context. The output is the assembled dream prompt text.
