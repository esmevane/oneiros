argument-hint: <agent-name>

Run `oneiros introspect $ARGUMENTS` to generate a session summary for the named agent. This captures the current session's key events and decisions before context compaction occurs.

Use before context compaction to preserve session continuity. The output is an introspection prompt that should be processed to generate a summary cognition.
