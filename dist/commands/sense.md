description: Interpret an external event through an agent's cognitive lens
argument-hint: <agent-name>
---

Run `oneiros sense $ARGUMENTS` to sense an observation as the named agent. Pipe event data via stdin for the agent to interpret, or run without stdin for a general observation prompt.

The output is a sense template. Process it to interpret the event and record significant observations as cognitions or experiences.
