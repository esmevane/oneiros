description: Install the oneiros skill for Claude Code
argument-hint: "[--global]"
---

Run `oneiros skill install` to install the oneiros skill to the current project's `.claude/` directory and set up AGENTS.md. Use `--global` to install to `~/.claude/` instead.

This writes the SKILL.md, plugin.json, command files, and resource files that Claude Code needs to discover and use oneiros.
