# Salvage corrupted brains

As the glorious headline might tell you: I goofed the db up in a migration. This led to me putting the import/export/replay features into things, and also led to this tool. This just takes a badly mangled event log and fixes it. Everything's hardwired and this is made to be thrown right back out. Oops.
